# Hotel-Data-Project

This project focused on getting data from a csv/tsv file and converting it into a visually appealing Executive Dashboard.
Firstly, I imported the data into MS SQL and performed some minor data cleaning on columns and data types.
Next, I used a few queries utilizing UNIONs and JOINs to combine all 5 tables in the data set so that they can be used together. I also used some queries to get the data needed for the executive dashboard in order to understand what kind of functions will be needed in Power BI.
Then, the data was moved to PowerBI where I used PowerQuery (DAX, measures and calculated columns) to introduce new data and information that was necessary for the dashboard.
Finally, I built a basic, but visually appealing Exec Dashboard showcasing primary KPIs, Yearly trend charts and slicers to navigate the data easily.
